# Lab Assignment 03

In this lab you will practice writing Java code to **perform simple arithmetic**.

Same as Lab Assignment 01 and 02, you need to set up your workspace (class and main() method).

## Let's get started!

First, let's look at the name of our .java file in the `src/` directory and name our class accordingly and remember to make it `public`.

Next, **create your main() method inside your class**. It should be the same as in Lab Assignment 01 and 02. Try writing the main() method without looking at your notes. Writing your main class and method should come to you as natural as in C++.

Now let the fun begin!

### Arithmetic operations

Exactly the same as C++. Only Java has the shift arithmetic operators (<<, >>).

Arithmetic operators **return a numeric value**.

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `+` | Adds values together |
| `-` | Subtracts right value from left value |
| `*` | Multiplies values together |
| `/` | Divides right value by left value |
| `%` | Returns the remainder of division |
| `++` | Increments value by `1` |
| `--` | Decrements value by `1` |

Arithmetic operations follow the **PEMDAS** order of operations:

1. Parenthesis
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication & Division
5. Addision & Subtraction

### Assignment Operators

Also, exactly the same as C++. For arithmetic assignment operators, the variable `x` must have a value previously assigned to it.

| Operator | Example | Same As |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `=` | `x = 5` | `x = 5` |
| `+=` | `x += 5` | `x = x + 5` |
| `-=` | `x -= 5` | `x = x - 5` |
| `*=` | `x *= 5` | `x = x * 5` |
| `/=` | `x /= 5` | `x = x / 5` |
| `%=` | `x %= 5` | `x = x % 5` |

## Your Assignment

### Bank Account

Bob has a checking acount with Texas Bank with a starting balance of $`2175.37`.

Bob then performs the following transactions:

1. Bob **withdrew** $`302.50`.

2. Bob **deposited** $`50.03`.

3. Bob **withdrew** half of his current balance, then **deposited** $`20.00`.

4. Bob **withdrew** $`1`.

5. Bob **deposited** his paycheck that doubled his current balance.

6. Bob **withdrew** $`1`.

Output Bob's new balance after all of his transactions.
